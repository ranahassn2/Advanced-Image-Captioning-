# Advanced-Image-Captioning-
 •
 Scope: The project focused on building a model capable of recognizing and describing the content of images
 •
 Technologies Used: Transformers, deep neural networks for understanding image content and generating
 appropriate captions.
 •
 Implementation: The model was trained using a large dataset of images and captions, utilizing techniques
 like LSTM, InceptionV3, and Transformers from the beginning.
 •
 Outcomes: The model generated captions with an 92% accuracy rate, significantly improving user
 engagement on social media platforms by 40%.
